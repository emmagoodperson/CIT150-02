# CIT150-02

This repository explains the installation of the CIT150-02 conductivity probe on the Reverse Osmosis unit in the RHIT Unit Operations Laboratory.
This flow meter was installed in March of 2023 by the CHE525 Process Analytics class.

The Endress + Hauser Liquiline CM444  can transmit a variety of parameters such as conductivity, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and many other parameters. For the purpose of Reveros Osmosis, we installed the condutivity probe (CLS15D/CLS15-B) to measure the conducitivy of the permeate stream.
